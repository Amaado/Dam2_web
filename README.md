## ⓘ General Information

I created this website because my institute’s main menu was horrible.

This custom and huge improvement makes me work more comfortably.

This is the v2.

If you have entered the website, you discovered that it is not just the main menu... I’ll say no more; if you want, you’ll discover it on your own.

## ⚠︎ Disclaimer

I have nothing bad to say about bald people. In fact, I have a good relationship with most of them. This was about the worst professor I’ve ever seen, who “teaches” me this year. The aesthetic might look very similar to him, but it’s not him. Obviously, all the stuff on the page is for personal use only, without the intention of hurting anybody. Just to give you a little bit more of context, a friend of mine’s hamsters died and she was struggling with that. That’s why I decided to include them, in their honor. RIP Cocco, Biggie and Dior.
